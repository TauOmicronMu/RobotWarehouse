README FOR JOBSELECTION:

To use job selection classes for a single robot:

-Create a new JobAssignerSingle object:

	Constructor format: 
	
	JobAssignerSingle(Robot robot, LinkedList<Job> trainingJobs)
	
	where robot is the Robot object the jobs are being assigned to, and trainingJobs is a LinkedList<Job>.
	trainingJobs MUST have cancellation booleans parsed and set, otherwise the Naive Bayes will return incorrect
	probabilities.

	This JobAssignerSingle object will then create a new JobAssignedEvent whenever it assigns a job to the robot,
	containing the robot and the assigned job - any class which needs to know which robot has which job (route execution,
	management interface, robot interface etc.) can listen for this event and recieve it whenever the robot is assigned
	a new AssignedJob. 	
	
	The JobAssignerSingle will wait once a job has been assigned, until it receives either:
	
		- a JobCompleteEvent, upon which it will assign the next best job.
		- a JobCancelledEvent, upon which it will recalculate based on the Robot object's current location field and reassign.
		- a RobotLostEvent, upon which it will recalculate based on the Robot object's current location field and reassign.
	
	The JobAssignerSingle will stop and terminate once either:
	
		- the JobAssignerSingle.stopAssigning() method is called.
		- the JobAssignerSingle runs out of jobs to assign.
